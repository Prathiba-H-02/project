### IoT based automated UV disinefcting bin (Covid-19 Waste Managament System)
- This bin is a protoype developed for collection used facemasks and disnfecting them to promote safe waste collection in times of pandemic.An online survey was conducted whihc showed Facemasks are the most commonly used Covid-19 safety equipment. Today tonnes of waste is additionally generated with the usage of safety equipments like face masks, face shields, gloves ,PPE's etc , making waste management more challenging. 
- The bin is developed with the following components:
   1. Ultrasonic sensors
   2. Arduino UNO
   3. GSM modem
   4. NodeMcu
   5. Servo motor
   6. RTC
   7. LCD display board
- The status of bin is backed up in adafruit cloud and displayed in dashboard.
- Also notifies user with SMS in case of internet issues.
- Connecting and deploying many bins in schools, apartments or buildings helps in managing and reduces mixing up of biomedical waste with common waste. 
- Collected masks from a building can be segregated based on the type of fabric,which classifies it to degradable and biodegradable waste. N-95 masks can be resued after UV-C light disinfection contributing to safer and healthy society.
