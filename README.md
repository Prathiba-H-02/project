### IoT based automated UV disinfecting bin (Covid-19 Waste Management System)
- This bin is a protoype developed for collection of used facemasks and disinfecting them to promote safe waste collection in times of pandemic.An online survey was conducted which showed face masks are the most commonly used Covid-19 safety equipment. Today, tonnes of waste is additionally generated with the usage of safety equipments like face masks, face shields, gloves ,PPE's etc , making waste management more challenging. 
- The bin is developed with the following components:
   1. Ultrasonic sensors
   2. Arduino UNO
   3. GSM modem
   4. NodeMcu
   5. Servo motor
   6. RTC
   7. LCD display board
- The status of bin is backed up in adafruit cloud and displayed in dashboard.
- Also notifies user with SMS in case of internet issues.
- Connecting and deploying many bins in schools, apartments or buildings helps in managing and reduces mixing up of biomedical waste with common waste. 
- Masks collected from a building can be segregated based on the type of fabric,which classifies it to degradable and biodegradable waste. N-95 masks can be reused after UV-C light disinfection contributing to safer and healthy society.
